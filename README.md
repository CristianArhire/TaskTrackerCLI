# Task Tracker CLI

A simple Command-Line Interface (CLI) application for managing your daily tasks. This project allows you to add, update, delete, and list your tasks from the terminal. Tasks are saved locally in a `tasks.json` file, making it easy to keep track of your to-do list.

---

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Create new tasks with a description.
- **Update Tasks**: Change the description of an existing task.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks by their unique ID.
- **Task Status Management**: Mark tasks as `all`, `in-progress`, or `done`.
- **List Tasks**: View all tasks or filter by their status.
- **Data Persistence**: All tasks are stored in a local JSON file (`tasks.json`).
- **No external dependencies**: Only .NET Standard Libraries are used.
